******WORK IN PROGRESS******

Welcome to the Interactive Event Map made by Lucas Wehr!

This is a project I'm still working on, but I think its best to show some progress into what I've been doing this past month.
I'm using mySQL to store and query data which taught me so much on how databases work and how it connects with my flask backend and react frontend.

Overview:

This project lets the user use a interactive world map that zooms in and out to find events that in a certain desired area. I use leaflet.js for the map, and I use icons and popups as the events. These events are located where it'll be hosted, making it easy to find where they are. As well as that, when you hover over an icon, theres many details that you can see on the fly such as when the event date is and time, a description, the vibe of the event, and the genre. Most events will also have a link that takes you directly to where you can buy a ticket, making it easier than ever to buy a ticket based off what you're looking for. Something recently I added is a filter button that filters the events based on how you're feeling. For example some one the options you can choose from is "Intense', which finds events with the genre metal. Another filter is "Energetic" which shows the user sports such as hockey or football games or pop. There are many other filters such as "laid-back" that finds genres like country, "smooth" which finds Jazz or R&B events, and many more. More often than not people don't know what event they want to see, and I hope this project helps people find the best event for them based off their mood.

Simplicity is what I'm focusing on, and this project has some simple instructions:

1.) Search any desired city you want

2.) Choose the amount of events you want to see

3.) Filter said events based on how you're feeling

4.) Filter Age Restrictions and start time for events

Again this is a work and progess, and I still plan more user friendly features such as estimated crowd size for each event.
